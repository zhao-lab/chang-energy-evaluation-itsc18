# Evaluation of the Fuel Economy and Emission for CAV using Real-world Driving Datasets

Developed the new evaluation method and standard which could evaluate the impacts on energy consumption and environmental pollution of CAV fairly, especially under the various traffic conditions. In this project, we proposed a new method to evaluate the fuel economy and emission level of the evaluated vehicle based on the unsupervised learning of the real-world driving data of the evaluated vehicle and typical driving primitive analysis of the naturalistic driving dataset of a large number of different vehicles.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

these packages are needed:

```

sklearn
pyhsmm
```

### Installing

Install these python packages:


Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
